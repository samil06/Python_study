File Handling: Write a Python script that can read a file, update a specific line, and then write the changes back to the file.

Classes and Objects: Implement a simple bank account class in Python. It should have methods to deposit and withdraw an amount, and also should keep track of the total amount of money in the account.

Data Visualization: Using matplotlib or seaborn, create a Python script that can plot a graph (line chart, bar chart, histogram, etc.) from a given set of data.

Web Scraping: Extend your previous web scraping task to not only get the links from a webpage, but to also fetch some specific data from those linked pages (e.g. headings or paragraphs).

Data Cleaning: Write a Python script that uses pandas to load a CSV file, identify any missing or null data in the file, and then clean the data by either removing the invalid entries or replacing them with valid data.

APIs: Write a Python script that can send a request to a REST API, receive the response, and then parse the JSON response to get some specific data.

Error Handling: Write a Python script where you purposefully raise an exception and then handle it using try/except blocks.

Regular Expressions: Write a Python script that validates user input using regular expressions. For example, check the validity of an email address or phone number.

Multithreading: Write a Python script that downloads several web pages concurrently using multithreading or multiprocessing.

Database Interaction: Write a Python script that inserts data into an SQL database, then update and delete specific entries. Ensure that you have the necessary error handling for situations where the operations may fail.
